    <p>I am working towards being a dental hygienist and overall being very successful. The experiences that led me here is me working very hard and always making sure to complete my work (even if its late). I volunteer and am active in my community. I am working towards these goals by being active in school. Even if I am absent, I try my best to work hard and make up my work. I make many short-term/long-term goals that are achievable. The values I consider most necessary for my success is to be on time with stuff. I try not to disappoint my teachers and work hard to participate and understand things. Short-term goals I hope to accomplish is filling out my volunteer form for NCH. I also hope to start my summer classes for dual enrollment. I also hope to take many online classes. Characters I want to be known for is hardworking, active, intelligent and overall kind. I want to have good traits and not procrastinate. I overall want to be known as studious and a good kid. My future is very important to me and therefore I work hard to make the best of it such as getting good grades.</p>
